 <h1>Vulnerability-Management-Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Vulnerability scans are executed on a Windows 10 virtual machine using Tenable's Nessus Essentials tool. The Windows 10 machine is set up with a few different configurations to analyze the differences in scan results. 

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nessus Essentials 10.8.1</b> 


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>VMWare Workstation Pro 17</b>
- <b>Windows 10 Pro</b>

Credentialed Scans

In order to run credentialed scans on the VM we will configure the Windows 10 VM. This done since our machine
is not connected to a domain.

Entering Services.msc in the search bar we will enable remote registry allowing the scan to find any risky configurations.

Next, we navigate to User Account Control Settings and change the setting to Never notify for experimental purposes.

We will further disable account controls by navigating to the registry(regedit) and editing a registry key.

Navigate to HKLM-->Software-->Microsoft-->Windows-->CurrentVersion-->Policies-->System

Within System we add D-Word labed "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" and set the value to 1.
